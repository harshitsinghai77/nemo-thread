# Introducing Nemo Threads

<span style="color:red">The app has been temporarily suspended due to recent modifications in the Twitter API. The app's core functionalities were closely tied to specific features within the Twitter API.

Regrettably, this cost is not sustainable for us, compelling us to make the difficult decision to shut down the app.
